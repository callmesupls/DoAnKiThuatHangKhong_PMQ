			<p>Electrical system data is displayed at the bottom of the Engine Indication System (EIS) bar along the
				left side of the MFD. Main bus voltage is measured at the WARN circuit breaker on the X-FEED BUS.
				Essential bus voltage is measured at the NAV1 ENG circuit breaker on the ESS BUS.</p>
			<p>Both voltage (VOLTS) and current (AMPS) indications are shown on the EIS. Main bus voltage is shown below
				the “M”. Essential bus voltage is shown below the “E”. Main battery current is shown below the “M”.
				Standby battery current is displayed below the “S”. A positive AMPS value means the battery is charging,
				a negative value means that the battery is discharging.</p>
			<p>Normal voltage readings with the alternator operating should be about 28.0 volts. If main or essential
				bus voltage rises above 32.0 volts, the numerical value and VOLTS text turns red. This warning
				indication, along with a HIGH VOLTS annunciation on the PFD, is an indicator that the alternator is
				supplying too high of a voltage and the ALT MASTER switch should be positioned to OFF.</p>
			<p>If main or essential bus voltage drops below 24.5 volts, the numeric value and VOLTS text turns red. This
				warning indication, along with a LOW VOLTS annunciation on the PFD, is an indication that the alternator
				is not supplying enough power. Voltages between 24.5 and 28.0 volts may occur during low engine RPM
				conditions.</p>

			<p>Electrical system data is displayed at the bottom of the Engine Indication System (EIS) bar along the
				left side of the MFD. Main bus voltage is measured at the WARN circuit breaker on the X-FEED BUS.
				Essential bus voltage is measured at the NAV1 ENG circuit breaker on the ESS BUS.</p>
			<p>Both voltage (VOLTS) and current (AMPS) indications are shown on the EIS. Main bus voltage is shown below
				the “M”. Essential bus voltage is shown below the “E”. Main battery current is shown below the “M”.
				Standby battery current is displayed below the “S”. A positive AMPS value means the battery is charging,
				a negative value means that the battery is discharging.</p>
			<p>Normal voltage readings with the alternator operating should be about 28.0 volts. If main or essential
				bus voltage rises above 32.0 volts, the numerical value and VOLTS text turns red. This warning
				indication, along with a HIGH VOLTS annunciation on the PFD, is an indicator that the alternator is
				supplying too high of a voltage and the ALT MASTER switch should be positioned to OFF.</p>
			<p>If main or essential bus voltage drops below 24.5 volts, the numeric value and VOLTS text turns red. This
				warning indication, along with a LOW VOLTS annunciation on the PFD, is an indication that the alternator
				is not supplying enough power. Voltages between 24.5 and 28.0 volts may occur during low engine RPM
				conditions.</p>
